                                    Coding Blocks has been built with a vision of creating Software Developers and Entrepreneurs who can shape the future of our country. India has around 5 lac engineers graduating from colleges every year, majority of which aren't employable. On the other hand most of the Software Companies aren't able to fill their job vacancies because they don't get good candidates.
                                    <br>The problem lies in the fact that the content and methodology of teaching hasn't kept the pace with the fast changing IT sector. Another problem is that no IT professionals want to mentor/teach these students because teaching is far less lucrative financially compared to working for IT firms.

                                    UNV is administered by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and reports to the UNDP/UNFPA/UNOPS Executive Board. Read more about the added value of UNV, UN Volunteers and volunteerism.
                                    <br>At the country level, UNV Field Units interact with UN entities to strategically and meaningfully integrate volunteerism into the implementation and delivery of their mandates. As part of this process, UNV works with UN entities to identify opportunities where volunteers add specific and unique value to development programmes and peacekeeping missions. 
                                    The UN Partner Toolkit is the first point of entry for partners seeking information about mobilizing and managing UN Volunteers.

                                    These heroes need recognition not only to appreciate the efforts but to motivate others, in terms of making things possible with no support and with just self-determination.

These activities are never shown on TV or any media coverage, but we find it important to spread this message worldwide that, the neglected strata of the society needs attention. 
                                    They have some true performers hidden under the pile of poverty and lack of options. Still, there are some souls, that have been touched by God.

                                    Team Everest started it’s journey in 2006 when Karthee Vidya, founder of Team Everest finished his engineering and joined the corporate world. He donated from his first month salary and also collected donations from 3 of his friends. 
                                    With Rs 4000 in hand, he visited a rural school in Tamilnadu where 70% of the children were child labourers. He paid them school fees, donated uniforms, notebooks and other stationaries.From there we have grown to what we are today with the help of thousands of Volunteers. 
                                    The founder has quit his high paying corporate job and doing full time social work with Team Everest now.
                                    We have built a team of crazy people who love volunteering. We believe in the power of endless love every person has and want to tap that potential to make a difference in this world.
                                    <br>Being the Upcycle Intern, I contributed in creating and recycling the new ones from old ones.

But in the past few years, people in the country have come up and started talking about the mental problems they have been having and how they have been not been able to cope up with a proper mental state. 
                                    With more people coming forward to speak about this, the more people understood the seriousness of this issue. But still, a lot of people just consider this to be a superstition than a medical condition.

                                    and hence bridge the gap between them and the world. As explained by the founder himself in his story, poverty and education are inextricably linked, because people living in poverty may stop going to school, 
                                    so they can work which leaves them without literacy that they need for their careers.
